# H.P.S.C (Hyper Project Setup Cli)
 Hpsc is a tool to make an html project.

 It's like vite but for plain html and css.

 It just saves time. Instead of manually making and linking all the files just use this.

# How to install
 Download the latest exe from the releases tab

 Move it to any folder

 Add the folder its in to path variable

 Restart terminal and run `hpsc`

 If it says no arguments passed then it is installed!

# How to use
 Run hpsc (path to your folder)

 It will ask you some questions. Just answer those.
